# FINDINGS.md — surprises and breakages, with how each was verified

## 2026-10-14 — Mendix 11.15.0 deploy build needs JDK 25; container JAVA_HOME is 21
- **Symptom:** doctor gate self-test FAIL "gate cannot read mxbuild's error file (baseline run)".
- **Cause:** mxbuild 11.15.0 exit 3, `errors[]`: gradle `:compile` → "release version 25 not supported" under
  JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64; `problems[]` empty, so the gate correctly read "?".
- **Fix:** JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-25-openjdk-amd64 (JDK 25 is installed in the image), pinned in
  `.claude/settings.json` env. **Verified:** direct mxbuild on a scratch copy → BUILD SUCCEEDED; doctor
  self-test → baseline 0 errors, known-bad control 1 error.
